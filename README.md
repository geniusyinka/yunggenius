<!-- <p>I'm a creative Full Stack Engineer who's passionate about making things and pivoting to web3. I work with and have proficiency in PHP and JavaScript. I've also worked with a handful of Laravel projects with React as the Frontend library. Also built out a couple of web3 User Interfaces, and interacted with tools like: hardhat, ethersJS amongts others. I have a background in media and this gives me a rather intresting view when solving problems with code. The ability to mix Technological tools with an artistic backgroud is my super power. </p>
